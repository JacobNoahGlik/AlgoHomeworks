# HW2 Breakdown - and what to submit

## Overview
Homework 2 has 3 parts. 
1. Lucas Numbers
2. Details of Lucas Numbers
3. Subirachs Magic Square

Parts 1 and 2 can be combined as part 2 encapsulates part 1. However part 3 is a standalone part.

## Parts 1 and 2 (Lucas Numbers + details)

Once you have completed parts 1 and 2, you should have a program that accepts a number `n` and prints the Lucas Numbers from `0` to `n`. You should then display the 
times taken to calculate these values (`0` to `n`) and lastly their ratios.

Answer the question `What is the order of growth of your algorithm?` in either your code and display to terminal or in your `README.txt`/`README.md` file attached in 
your submition.

Lastly repeat the process above with a custom sequence of numbers (change the starting values of `number 0` and `number 1`).

## Part 3 (Subirachs Magic Square)

Most students get tripped up by the "square" and try to encapsulate it's properties in their code. **Don't do that**.

After reading part 3 of the assignment (before starting to write code) students **should** see that the square itself is not relevent but instead the values are 
what's important.

```java
int[] square = {1, 14, 14, 4, 11, 7, 6, 9, 8, 10, 10, 5, 13, 2, 3, 15};
```
